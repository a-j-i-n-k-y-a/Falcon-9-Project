# IBM Data Science Capstone Project: Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing

This capstone project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The objective is to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. 

## Project Overview

SpaceX has been successful in reducing the cost of rocket launches due to the reusability of its first stage. Predicting the success of this landing is valuable because it directly impacts the cost of a launch. This information can be used by alternative companies who want to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

The project is divided into five weeks, each with specific objectives and learning outcomes.

## Week 1

We start with an overview of the problem and the tools needed for the course. This week focuses on manipulating data in Python, converting JSON files into pandas data frames, creating and sharing Jupyter notebooks, and utilizing data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem.

## Week 2

In the second week, we collect data on Falcon 9 first-stage landings through a RESTful API and web scraping. We convert this data into a pandas data frame and perform data wrangling. This week involves creating scatter plots and bar charts, conducting exploratory data analysis, and executing SQL queries to select and sort data.

## Week 3

This week involves building an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash to analyze launch records. We also build an interactive map with Folium to analyze the proximity of launch sites. 

## Week 4

In the fourth week, we use machine learning to predict the success of Falcon 9's first stage landing. We split our data into training and testing sets, train different classification models, and optimize hyperparameters using grid search. 

## Week 5

In the final week, we compile all our activities and deliver data-driven insights to predict the success of Falcon 9's first stage landing.
